# Explain

This is my archlinux installation script.

You must modify the installation script before use, and modify the content such as "yourlocale" according to the situation.

This installation script is only suitable for some users and specific situations. Please also modify it according to the actual situation and personal preference.

install.sh is used to install the system, and config.sh is used to configure the system after arch chroot. You need to run install.sh after you start the installation image, arch chroot to the new system, and then run config.sh.

The permissions for install.sh and config.sh are set to executable.
