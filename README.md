# Explain
This is my archlinux installation script, only for specific users, please modify the script before use.

install.sh is used to install the system, and config.sh is used to configure the system after arch chroot. You need to run install.sh after you start the installation image, arch chroot to the new system, and then run config.sh.

The permissions for install.sh and config.sh are set to executable.
